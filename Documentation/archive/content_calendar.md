### **Detailed Descriptions & Strategy**

- **Week 1: Launch & Awareness**

  - **Post 1 (Launch Announcement):** This is the flagship post announcing NeuroDesk's public availability. It will cover the vision, the problem we solve (missed calls), and our solution, echoing the "Never miss a customer opportunity" messaging.
  - **Post 2 (The True Cost):** A high-value, top-of-funnel piece that targets a broad SEO keyword. It establishes credibility by framing the core business pain point (lost revenue) that NeuroDesk solves.

- **Week 2: Building Trust & Proving Value**

  - **Post 3 (How AI Works):** This demystifies the "AI" aspect of the product for a non-technical audience. It explains the concept of voice automation in simple terms, building trust.
  - **Post 4 (Case Study):** This is crucial social proof. Using data from a successful beta customer, it demonstrates tangible results (e.g., "Captured 25% More Leads"), directly appealing to the ROI-focused Business Owner.

- **Week 3: Driving Action & Deeper Engagement**

  - **Post 5 (5 Repetitive Tasks):** This post directly targets the Office Manager persona with a practical, list-based article that provides immediate value and clearly maps to product features.
  - **Post 6 (Answering Service vs. AI):** This comparison post targets a high-intent audience actively looking for a solution, positioning NeuroDesk as the modern, superior alternative.

- **Week 4: Overcoming Objections & Building Community**
- **Post 7 (Voicemail is a Lead):** This thought leadership piece aims to shift the reader's perspective on a common business process, positioning NeuroDesk as an innovative partner.
- **Post 8 (Launch Learnings):** As mentioned in the GTM plan, this post fosters transparency and community. It summarizes feedback from early users, shows that the team is listening, and can subtly tease upcoming feature tweaks or improvements.
