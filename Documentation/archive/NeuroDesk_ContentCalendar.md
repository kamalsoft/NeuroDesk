### **Detailed Descriptions & Strategy**

- **Week 1: Launch & Awareness**

  - **Post 1 (Launch Announcement):** This is the flagship post announcing NeuroDesk's public availability. It will cover the vision, the problem we solve (missed calls), and our solution.
  - **Post 2 (Industry Pain Point):** A high-value, top-of-funnel piece that targets a specific vertical (auto dealerships). It establishes credibility and addresses a core pain point.

- **Week 2: Building Trust & Proving Value**

  - **Post 3 (How It Works):** This demystifies the "AI" aspect of the product. It explains the concept of voice automation in simple terms, building trust.
  - **Post 4 (Case Study):** This is crucial social proof. Using data from a successful beta customer, it demonstrates tangible results (e.g., "Booked 20% More Appointments").

- **Week 3: Driving Action & Deeper Engagement**

  - **Post 5 (Insight to Action):** This post directly targets the user by showing them how to move from a voice request to an automated action using the workflow engine.
  - **Post 6 (ROI Comparison):** This data-driven post appeals to the budget-conscious business owner by comparing the cost of a human receptionist to the value of an AI solution.

- **Week 4: Overcoming Objections & Building Community**
  - **Post 7 (Why Your Current Tools Aren't Enough):** This post handles a common objection ("My phone system has voicemail"). It highlights the unique value of an intelligent, actionable system.
  - **Post 8 (Launch Learnings):** This post fosters transparency and community by summarizing feedback from early users and showing that the team is listening.
